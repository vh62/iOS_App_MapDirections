# iOS_App_MapDirections

Build a simple MapApp to find locations and display a carousel bar in swift from LBTA. 

<img src= "Map_IOS.gif" width=200/>

Used LBTATools dependencies from Brian Voong's website.
### Thoughts 
LBTATools is easy to use, but takes away the learning experience from implementing autoLayout on your own.
